NAME
    Maypole::Plugin::Component - Run Maypole sub-requests as components

SYNOPSIS
        package MyApp;
        use Maypole::Application qw(Component);

        [% request.component("/beer/view_as_component/20") %]

DESCRIPTION
    This subclass of Maypole allows you to integrate the results of a
    Maypole request into an existing request. You'll need to set up actions
    and templates which return fragments of HTML rather than entire pages,
    but once you've done that, you can use the "component" method of the
    Maypole request object to call those actions. You may pass a query
    string in the usual URL style. You should not fully qualify the Maypole
    URLs.

    Note that you need Maypole 2.0 or newer to use this module.
